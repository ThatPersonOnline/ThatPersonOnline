This is for Bioshock 2 Multiplayer on how to end games instantly. in order to do this you must go to Browse local files, Mp, Content, Flash Movies then replace your ingameloadout with what i sent and it should work. gl and have fun!
also if you want no effects such as removing the bigdaddy helmet and other things go to. Browse local files, Mp, Builds, Binaries, then replace the default file with what i sent and that should also work. and if you'd like to re open and close the cheat menu go to mp, content,flash movies, and replace your own pause file with mine and rename the cheat menu to something else.
