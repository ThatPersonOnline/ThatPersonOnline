if you'd like to re open and close the cheat menu go to mp, content,flash movies, and replace your own pause file with mine and rename the cheat menu to something else.
for the default file go to browse local files, mp, builds, binaries. then replace your default file with what i sent and it should allow you to remove all effects in game.
