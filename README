This is for Bioshock 2 Multiplayer on how to end games instantly. in order to do this you must go to Browse local files, Mp, Content, Flash Movies then replace your ingameloadout with what i sent and it should work. gl and have fun!
and if you'd like to re open and close the cheat menu go to mp, content,flash movies, and replace your own pause file with mine and rename the cheat menu to something else.
